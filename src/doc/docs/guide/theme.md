# Themes

By default, plugin assumes [material](https://github.com/squidfunk/mkdocs-material) theme usage, but
you can use [any other theme](https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs/wiki/MkDocs-Themes) if you want.

## Changing theme

To apply a new theme you'll need:

* Add theme package
* Apply new theme in mkdocs.yml
* (optional) Remove material-related configurations in mkdocs.yml

For example, lets configure [ivory theme](https://github.com/daizutabi/mkdocs-ivory).

First, we need to declare it's package in build.gradle:

```groovy
python.pip 'mkdocs-ivory:0.4.6'
```

!!! note
    Additional optional packages may be required for theme (e.g. like for material theme).
    Just add all required packages:
    
    ```groovy
    python.pip 'mkdocs-ivory:0.4.6', 
               'some-additional-package:1.0'
    ```
    

Then changing theme in mkdocs.yml:

```yaml
theme:
  name: 'ivory'
```

## Material-related configurations

Default mkdocs.yml ([generated by plugin](tasks.md#init)) contains special configurations 
related to material theme, which may be removed (in case of other theme used):

```yaml
theme:
  name: 'material'
  # Material theme configuration flag
  feature:
    tabs: false


#extra:
#  Material theme palette configurations
#  palette:
#    primary: 'indigo'
#    accent: 'indigo'

#  Material theme social links configuration
#  social:
#    - icon: fontawesome/brands/github
#      link: https://github.com/you
#    - icon: fontawesome/brands/twitter
#      link: https://twitter.com/you


# Extensions used by material
markdown_extensions:
  - admonition
  - codehilite:
      guess_lang: false
  - footnotes
  - meta
  - def_list
  - toc:
      permalink: true
  - pymdownx.betterem:
      smart_enable: all
  - pymdownx.caret
  - pymdownx.inlinehilite
  - pymdownx.magiclink
  - pymdownx.smartsymbols
  - pymdownx.superfences
```

!!! note
    I don't know if `markdown_extensions` would work with your theme. 
    You can experiment if you need these extra features (see [material theme guide](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/abbreviations/)
    for extensions usage examples).
