Instead, git-publish plugin is used for publication. By default, no configuration is required. Only project itself must be published to git so that plugin could calculate default url (or mkdocs.publish.repoUrl manually specified). On the first mkdocsPublish task call: gh-pages branch will be created in the same repo built site pushed to gh-pages repository branch Later mkdocsPublish task calls will only remove current version folder (replace with the new one) or publish completely new version only. You can find actual gh-pages branch inside .gradle/gh-pages (this checkout is used for publishing). Gradle folder is used to cache repository checkout because eventually it would contain many versions and there is no need to checkout all of them each time (folder could be changed with mkdocs.publish.repoDir ). Authentication \u00b6 By default, git-publish will ask credentials with a popup (swing). Even if github pages are published on the same repo, the repo is checked out into different folder and so current repository credentials can't be used automatically. You can specify credentials as: Environment variables: GRGIT_USER (could be github token ), GRGIT_PASS System properties: org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username (could be github token), org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password Ssh key properties: org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.ssh.private (path to key), org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.ssh.passphrase See details in grgit docs . Plugin will automatically bind gradle properties org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.* to system properties (just before gitPublishReset ). This allows you to define credentials as global gradle properties in ~/.gradle/gradle.properties : org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username = user org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password = pass For testing, you can define properties inside gradle script: ext [ 'org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.username' ] = 'user' ext [ 'org.ajoberstar.grgit.auth.password' ] = 'pass' Publish additional resources \u00b6 If you want to publish not only generated site, but something else too then configure git-publish plugin to include additional content. For example, to include javadoc: gitPublish . contents { from ( javadoc ) { // need to use resolveDocPath because by default it's a template into \"\\${mkdocs.resolveDocPath()}/javadoc\" } } // dependency will NOT be set automatically by copySpec above gitPublishReset . dependsOn javadoc With this configuration, calling mkdocsPublish will publish generated mkdocs site with extra javadoc folder inside (you can put relative link to it inside documentation). Advanced publishing configuration \u00b6 To be able to configure advanced cases, you need to understand how everything works in detail. Here is how git-publish plugin is configured by default: gitPublish { repoUri = mkdocs . publish . repoUri branch = mkdocs . publish . branch repoDir = file ( mkdocs . publish . repoDir ) commitMessage = mkdocs . publish . comment contents { from ( \"${mkdocs.buildDir}\" ) } if ( multi_version_publish ) { preserve { include '**' exclude \"${mkdocs.publish.docPath}/**\" } } } Customized tasks dependency chain: mkdocsBuild <- gitPublishReset <- gitPublishCopy <- gitPublishCommit <- gitPublishPush <- mkdocsPublish Publication process: mkdocsBuild build site into $mkdocs.buildDir/$mkdocs.publish.docPath (by default, build/mkdocs/$version/ ) root redirect index.html generated (by default, build/mkdocs/index.html ) gitPublishReset clones gh-pages repo (by default, into .gradle/gh-pages ) or creates new one cleanup repo according to gitPublish.preserve (by default, .gradle/gh-pages/$version/ folder removed only) gitPublishCopy copies everything according to gitPublish.contents (by default, everything from build/mkdocs ) gitPublishCommit , gitPublishPush - commit changes and push to gh-pages repository (by default, gh-pages branch in current repo) You can configure additional folders for publication with contents (as shown above with javadoc) and cleanup extra directories with preserve configuration. For example: gitPublish { contents { from 'build/custom-dir' { into 'custom-dir' } } preserve { exclude 'custom-dir' } } Here extra build/custom-dir directory added for publication (into custom-dir ) and previous custom-dir folder (already committed) will be removed before publication. site_url \u00b6 site_url configuration defined in mkdocs.yml should point to the site root. It may be github pages or some custom domain. Setting affect home icon link, page metadata and links in generated sitemap.xml. When multi-version publishing used (by default), this url must point to documentation version folder (otherwise links will be incorrect in the sitemap). To avoid manual changes, just configure root site url (e.g. http://myroot.com/ ) and plugin will automatically change site_url before mkdocsBuild (for example, to http://myroot.com/1.0/ ; see build log - it will show updated url). Config is reverted back after the task, so you will not have to commit or revert changes. If site_url option is not defined at all (or multi-version publishing is not enabled) then config will not be changed. You can disable automatic configuration changes: mkdocs . updateSiteUrl = false Note that mkdocsServe is not affected (will generate with the original site_url) because it is not important for documentation writing (you can always call mkdocsBuild and validate urls correctness).","title":"Publication"},{"location":"guide/publication/#publication","text":"Note Plugin does not use mkdocs publication , because it does not support multi-versioning.

For example: gitPublish { contents { from 'build/custom-dir' { into 'custom-dir' } } preserve { exclude 'custom-dir' } } Here extra build/custom-dir directory added for publication (into custom-dir ) and previous custom-dir folder (already committed) will be removed before publication.","title":"Advanced publishing configuration"},{"location":"guide/publication/#site_url","text":"site_url configuration defined in mkdocs.yml should point to the site root. It may be github pages or some custom domain. Setting affect home icon link, page metadata and links in generated sitemap.xml. When multi-version publishing used (by default), this url must point to documentation version folder (otherwise links will be incorrect in the sitemap). To avoid manual changes, just configure root site url (e.g. http://myroot.com/ ) and plugin will automatically change site_url before mkdocsBuild (for example, to http://myroot.com/1.0/ ; see build log - it will show updated url). Config is reverted back after the task, so you will not have to commit or revert changes. If site_url option is not defined at all (or multi-version publishing is not enabled) then config will not be changed. You can disable automatic configuration changes: mkdocs . updateSiteUrl = false Note that mkdocsServe is not affected (will generate with the original site_url) because it is not important for documentation writing (you can always call mkdocsBuild and validate urls correctness).","title":"site_url"},{"location":"guide/tasks/","text":"Tasks \u00b6 Init \u00b6 mkdocsInit task generate initial site version into src/doc (or custom location).
